    "# Morphological Image Processing From Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphological image processing is a fundamental set of operations in computer vision that treats images as sets of pixels and manipulates their shapes and structures. While these operations might seem simple, they serve as powerful tools for image enhancement, feature detection, and pattern analysis. Morphological operations work by applying structuring elements to an image, systematically modifying the image based on the interaction between these elements and the image pixels.\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement various morphological operations from scratch using pure NumPy, which will help us understand the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of morphological image processing. Rather than relying on pre-built functions, we'll create our own implementations to gain deeper insights into how these algorithms work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Covered\n",
